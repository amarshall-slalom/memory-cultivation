  - [x] Linter clean
  - [x] Commit: "chore: mock AI calls in unit tests for faster execution" (ef56f6c)

### 3.2a AI-Powered Batch Consolidation (NEW)

#### Design Overview: Progressive Memory Consolidation

**Problem**: When 100+ memory files accumulate, processing them all at once:
- Burns through API credits unnecessarily
- Produces overwhelming output for user to review
- Doesn't scale well

**Solution**: Binary tree batch consolidation approach
- Process memories in batches of ≤20
- Use recursive halving for larger sets
- User approves each consolidation
- Creates intermediate consolidated files
- Final pass suggests instruction improvements

**Note on Branch-Based Memories**: 
- With branch-based naming, you'll have fewer files but each file may be VERY long
- A single feature branch could have 50+ commits → one huge `.memory/feature-auth.md` file
- Batching still applies: Split the commit entries within the file into batches
- Or treat each branch memory file as a single "memory" for consolidation purposes

**Example Flow (100 memory files OR 100 commit entries across 5 branch files)**:
```
100 memories → split → 50 oldest
50 memories → split → 25 oldest  
25 memories → split → 13 oldest
13 memories → ✓ consolidate → consolidated-001.md (user approves)
Repeat for next 13 → consolidated-002.md
...continues until all processed
Result: 8 consolidated files + original memories deleted
Final pass: Analyze 8 consolidated files for instruction suggestions
```

      "consolidate-batch": {
        "model": "gpt-5",      // More powerful for batch consolidation
        "prompt": "You are consolidating multiple memory summaries from commits. Synthesize these memories into a single coherent summary that captures: 1) Key behavioral changes, 2) Important structural patterns, 3) Technical decisions made. Be concise but preserve important details."

- Consolidated files are treated as first-class memories in subsequent passes
- User can manually review/edit consolidated files before final pass

#### User Experience Flow

```
$ npm run cultivate

=== Memory Cultivation ===

Found 100 memory files

Phase 1: Batch Consolidation
-----------------------------
You have more than 20 memories. Let's consolidate them in batches.

Batch 1/8: Consolidating 13 memories (Dec 1-5, 2024)
[AI generates consolidation...]

=== Batch 1 Consolidation ===
Behavioral changes:
- Implemented JWT authentication
- Added password reset flow
...

Structural changes:
- Refactored auth module for clarity
- Renamed userId → userID pattern
...

Options:
  y - Approve consolidation (delete 13 originals, save consolidated)
  n - Skip this batch (keep originals)
  edit - Write your own summary
  retry - Regenerate with AI

Your choice: y

✓ Batch 1 consolidated → .memory/consolidated-1734901234.md

  - [x] Write E2E test for complete pre-commit workflow (tests/preCommitHook.test.js)
  - [ ] Write E2E test for complete cultivation workflow ⏸️ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
  - [x] Verify all tests pass

  - [x] Verify all edge cases handled
  - [x] Commit: "behavioral: add edge case handling and tests"

    - ❌ Need tests with real copilot when available, graceful skip when not

### 6.3 Integration Testing Strategy
- [ ] **NEW**: Establish integration testing patterns
  - [ ] **Philosophy**:
    - Unit tests mock external dependencies (child_process, fs)
    - Integration tests check real command execution when available
    - Tests gracefully skip with clear messages when dependencies missing
    - No false positives from over-mocking
  - [ ] **Implementation**:
    - [ ] Create helper: `isCommandAvailable(command)` - checks if CLI tool installed
    - [ ] Pattern: `test.skipIf(!isCommandAvailable('copilot'), 'message', () => {...})`
    - [ ] Integration tests marked with tag or separate file: `*.integration.test.js`
    - [ ] CI can run `npm test` (unit only) or `npm run test:integration` (both)
  - [ ] **Specific Tests Needed**:
    - [ ] `aiCli.integration.test.js` - real copilot summarization
    - [ ] `aiConsolidation.integration.test.js` - real copilot consolidation
    - [ ] Test shell escaping with special characters in prompts
    - [ ] Test multiline prompt handling
    - [ ] Test model selection flag is passed correctly
  - [ ] Commit: "structural: establish integration testing patterns"

### 6.4 Final Validation
- [ ] Run full test suite (unit tests) - **NEEDS UPDATE after 3.2.2**
- [ ] Run integration test suite - **NEW**
- [ ] Run linter and fix any warnings
- [ ] Test in real repository scenarios with real copilot
- [ ] Verify all documentation is accurate
- [ ] Commit: "behavioral: validate with integration tests"

---

## Phase 7: Memory Regeneration Tool

### 7.1 Manual Memory Recovery
When memories are missed (e.g., PR merged without hook running, manual commits to main), users need a way to retroactively generate memories.

- [ ] **BEHAVIORAL** (TDD Cycle): Generate memory from commit hash
  - [ ] Write failing test: `shouldGenerateMemoryFromCommitHash`
    - Test with commit hash on main branch
    - Verify diff extracted correctly
    - Verify AI summarization called
    - Verify memory saved to user-specified filename
  - [ ] Write failing test: `shouldExcludeMarkdownFilesFromCommitDiff`
    - Verify MD files filtered out per existing rules
    - Verify only code changes included in diff
  - [ ] Write failing test: `shouldRequireUserToSpecifyFilename`
    - Test that filename parameter is required
    - Test that filename is saved to .memory/ directory
    - Test that filename validation (no path traversal)
  - [ ] Implement `npm run remember -- --commit <hash> --name <filename>`
    - Get commit diff from git (main branch only)
    - Filter out MD files and non-code changes
    - Call AI summarization (reuse existing logic)
    - Save to `.memory/<filename>.md`
    - Validate filename (alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores only)
  - [ ] Write failing test: `shouldSupportPRNumberLookup`
    - User provides `--pr <number>` instead of commit hash
    - Lookup merge commit for that PR
    - Generate memory from merge commit
  - [ ] Implement PR number support
    - Use `gh pr view <number> --json mergeCommit`
    - Extract commit hash
    - Proceed with commit-based flow
  - [ ] Verify all tests pass
  - [ ] Commit: "behavioral: add memory regeneration tool for missed commits"

- [ ] **STRUCTURAL**: Add usage documentation
  - [ ] Update README with memory regeneration examples
  - [ ] Add error messages for invalid inputs
  - [ ] Document use cases (manual commits, missed PRs, etc)
  - [ ] Commit: "structural: document memory regeneration feature"

**Use Cases:**
- PR merged but hook didn't run
- Manual commits pushed directly to main
- Want to create memory for specific historical commit
- Migrating to memory-cultivation tool (backfill old commits)

**Example Usage:**
```bash
# Generate from commit hash
npm run remember -- --commit abc123 --name fix-auth-bug

# Generate from PR number
npm run remember -- --pr 42 --name feature-user-profiles

# Result: Creates .memory/fix-auth-bug.md with AI summary
```

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- Support additional AI CLIs (Claude, Gemini, Kiro)
- More granular control over instruction file patterns
- Web-based UI for cultivation workflow
- Analytics on memory accumulation and cultivation patterns
- Automated instruction file optimization suggestions
- Multi-language support for prompts
- Batch memory regeneration (multiple commits at once)

---

## Development Principles Reminder

**TDD Cycle**: Always follow Red → Green → Refactor
1. Write a failing test (Red)
2. Write minimum code to pass (Green)
3. Refactor for clarity (while tests stay Green)

**Testing Strategy**:
- **Unit Tests**: Mock external dependencies (file system, child processes, network)
  - Fast, deterministic, run in CI always
  - Test logic and error handling in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Use real commands when available, skip gracefully when not
  - Test actual command execution and response parsing
  - Verify shell escaping, argument passing, model selection
  - Tagged separately (e.g., `*.integration.test.js`)
  - Should detect and skip if required CLI tools not installed
- **Avoid Over-Mocking**: If tests pass but code doesn't work, mocks are too permissive
  - Integration tests catch what over-mocked unit tests miss
  - Example: Wrong command `gh copilot` worked in tests but fails in reality

**Commit Discipline**: 
- Commit only when ALL tests pass
- Commit only when ALL linter warnings resolved
- Separate structural commits from behavioral commits
- Use descriptive commit messages with "structural:" or "behavioral:" prefix

**Tidy First**:
- Make structural changes first, behavioral changes after
- Never mix them in the same commit
- Run tests before and after structural changes to ensure no behavior change
