## Summary

Behavioral: Docs update the agent pre-coding workflow (PROJECT CONTEXT references, WORKFLOW.md moved/rewritten) and add an explicit "Create Pull Request" step requiring human approval; runtime now writes branch-scoped memory files (.memory/<sanitized-branch>.md) via a new appendMemory flow that creates/appends timestamped, numbered "Commit" entries and attempts to auto-stage the file with git add while tolerating git-add failures.  
Structural: Added a .memory summary file, moved WORKFLOW.md into .github/copilot/, added/exported appendMemory and getBranchFileName in src/memoryStorage.js (including a try/catch around execSync('git add')), and expanded tests in tests/memoryStorage.test.js to mock execSync/fs and validate branch-name sanitization, skipping main/master, timestamp formatting, commit-numbering, auto-stage invocation, and git-add error handling.
