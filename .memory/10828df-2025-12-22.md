## Summary

Behavioral: Docs change the agent's pre-coding workflow (new PROJECT CONTEXT: check spec.md/plan.md/WORKFLOW.md) and WORKFLOW.md now includes an explicit "Create Pull Request" step (gh pr create) plus a CRITICAL human-approve-and-merge requirement; code now also changes runtime behavior by adding branch-based memory file naming that skips main/master.  
Structural: Added two .memory summary files, moved WORKFLOW.md into .github/copilot/, added getBranchFileName to src/memoryStorage.js (and exported it), and expanded tests in tests/memoryStorage.test.js to mock execSync and validate branch-name sanitization and skipping main/master.
