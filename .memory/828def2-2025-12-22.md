## Summary

Intent: Summarizing diff changes

Behavioral: aiCli.js changes the AI invocation — it now loads config and delegates prompt building/execution to aiCommandBuilder/configReader (aiCommandBuilder.getPrompt + executeAICommand) instead of creating temp files and calling `gh copilot` via execSync, so runtime AI integration and configuration behavior changed.

Structural: Removed direct use of child_process/fs/path/os and temp files, refactored prompt composition into helper modules, simplified error messaging and fallback logic; overall a modularization/refactor of AI-related code.

Other: Added a new .memory metadata file and a small test-change.txt file.
