## Summary

Behavioral: Adds a new AI-driven "batch consolidation" feature (design and TDD plan) to progressively reduce large sets of .memory files into consolidated summaries (≤20 per batch), with AI consolidation, interactive user approval (y/n/edit/retry), saving consolidated-{timestamp}.md files, deletion of originals on approval, and integration points (consolidateBatch, saveConsolidatedMemory, batchConsolidator, changes to bin/cultivate.js) plus tests and workflows to run models like gpt-4o/gpt-5-mini.  

Structural: Config and CLI refactors and cleanup — introduces a configurable ai.command/commandArgs/operations JSON schema, moves toward an aiCommandBuilder/prompt-building utility, fixes command flags (use --model) and model defaults, removes placeholder memory files, and lists explicit refactor tasks (extract prompt creation, remove duplicate command logic, add logging/debug mode).  

Other: Spec and plan docs updated (typo fixes, clearer script flow, consolidated file format/example UX, and updated progress/status entries).
