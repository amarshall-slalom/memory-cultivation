## Summary

Behavioral: The Copilot instructions now require reviewing key project docs before starting work — a new "PROJECT CONTEXT" section telling the agent to check spec.md, plan.md, and WORKFLOW.md, which changes the agent's pre-coding workflow/behavior.  
Structural: COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS.md was edited to add the new section and the existing WORKFLOW.md was relocated into .github/copilot/ (rename only, no content changes).  
No code or runtime functionality was changed.
