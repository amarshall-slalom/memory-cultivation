## Summary

Behavioral: Docs update the agent pre-coding workflow (new PROJECT CONTEXT references and WORKFLOW.md moved/rewritten) and add an explicit "Create Pull Request" step with a CRITICAL human-approve-and-merge requirement; runtime behavior now writes branch-scoped memory files (skipping main/master), via a new appendMemory flow that creates or appends timestamped, numbered "Commit" entries to .memory/<sanitized-branch>.md.  
Structural: Added .memory summary file, moved WORKFLOW.md into .github/copilot/, added and exported appendMemory/getBranchFileName in src/memoryStorage.js, and expanded tests in tests/memoryStorage.test.js to mock execSync/fs and validate branch-name sanitization, skipping main/master, timestamp formatting, and commit-numbering.
