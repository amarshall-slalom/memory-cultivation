## Summary

Behavioral: Added an explicit "Create Pull Request" step to .github/copilot/WORKFLOW.md with a gh pr create command and a clarified prohibition that merging to main must be performed by a human (added “CRITICAL: Human must approve and merge”).  
Structural: Renumbered downstream sections (introduced a new step so 7→8), updated headings and small wording tweaks in the "Do NOT" list; changes are documentation-only.
