# Memory for branch: feature/plan-updates-npm-package

## Commit 1 - 2025-12-23 11:54:31

## Summary

Added a new file plan.md.backup containing an in-progress implementation plan and status for the project.  
Behavioral changes planned: add an npm package & install/setup flow (postinstall/bin/setup), a global CLI (memory-cultivate with subcommands), a memory-regeneration tool (generate memory from commit/PR), interactive instruction-file updates, and multiple new failing tests to drive those features.  
Structural/refactor changes planned: prepare package metadata and .npmignore, add CONFIGURATION.md and INTEGRATION.md, document usage, and refactor user interaction (extract prompt logic) along with other documentation and packaging tasks.

## Commit 2 - 2025-12-23 12:07:02

## Summary

Behavioral: No functional or runtime changes — no code, tests, or new features were added; only a file deletion occurred.  
Structural: Deleted plan.md.backup (a large in-progress implementation plan containing phases, TODOs, and completed checkpoints), a repository cleanup removing an obsolete planning/backup document.
